# Types of attack 

Bluejacking
Description: Sending unsolicited messages to nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. While it's often harmless, it can be used for social engineering attacks.

Bluesnarfing
Description: Unauthorized access to the information stored on a Bluetooth device (like contacts, calendar, etc.). This often occurs when a device is vulnerable or poorly configured.

BlueBorne Attack
Description: A collection of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute code on nearby devices without user interaction. It can affect a wide range of devices, including smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices.

Bluetooth Spoofing
Description: An attacker masquerades as a trusted device to connect and communicate with another device. This can lead to unauthorized access and data theft.

Man-in-the-Middle
Description: Intercepting and altering communications between two Bluetooth devices. This can happen during the pairing process or ongoing communication.

Bluetooth Denial of Service
Description: Overloading a Bluetooth device with connection requests, rendering it unusable. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in Bluetooth stacks.

# Tools for bluetooth penetration testing

BlueZ: A Linux Bluetooth protocol stack. It's useful for developing and testing Bluetooth applications

BlueMaho: A tool for Bluetooth scanning and exploitation.

BtleJuice: A framework for Man-in-the-Middle attacks on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer that can capture and analyze Bluetooth traffic when configured correctly.

Bluelog: A Bluetooth device discovery and information-gathering tool.

BtleJack: A tool for intercepting Bluetooth Low Energy communications.

# get contact and call history 

pip install pyobex
---------------------------------------python
from pyobex.client import Client

# Initialize Bluetooth Client
client = Client()

# Replace with your device's address
device_address = 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX'

# Connect to the device
client.connect(device_address)

# Request contacts or call history (this depends on the device's capabilities)
# Example command for sending a file (you would adapt this for contacts)
client.push('contacts.vcf')

# Disconnect when done
client.disconnect()
